        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An omelette is a dish you might order for breakfast or brunch â€” it's kind of like a folded pancake made of beaten eggs, 
           sometimes with the addition of vegetables, cheese, or meat.
           A good omelet is a little bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its filling.</p>
